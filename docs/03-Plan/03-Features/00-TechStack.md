# Tech Stack

Listed below are quick summaries of your tech stack. These can be services that are launched uniquely for you, or background processes that aid in servicing your processes.

## **Next.js**

**Description:** Next.js is a React framework that enables functionality such as server-side rendering and generating static websites for React-based web applications. It's designed to offer developers a simple way to start writing JavaScript applications that render output on the server side, improving the performance of complex applications and enhancing SEO. Is capable of serving pages many different ways, including

- SSR (Server Side Rendering, Dynamic Rendering)
- SSG (Static Site Generation)
- Incremental (Cached, rebuilt after a period of time)
- Hybrid (Combination of above)

These operate differently, and can cache and prebuild pages based on criteria from the developer.

**Reasons for Incorporation:**

- Offers built-in server-side rendering for faster page loads and improved SEO.
- Provides automatic code splitting, making the application lighter and faster.
- Supports static exporting, allowing you to render your pages as static HTML files.
- Facilitates an easy and intuitive development experience with hot code reloading.

## **Postgres**

**Description:** PostgreSQL (commonly known as Postgres) is a powerful, open-source object-relational database system. It extends the SQL language combined with many features that safely store and scale complicated data workloads.

**Reasons for Incorporation:**

- Offers a high degree of SQL compliance, making it easy to work with complex queries and procedures.
- Supports a variety of data types, including custom types, facilitating data integrity.
- Provides robust transactional support and performance optimization features.
- Offers extensive documentation and a supportive community for troubleshooting and development needs.

## **Redis Cache**

**Description:** Redis (REmote DIctionary Server) is an open-source, in-memory data structure store used as a database, cache, and message broker. As a caching layer, it temporarily stores frequently accessed data in memory, reducing the need to access the main database for data retrieval, thereby speeding up the application.

**Reasons for Incorporation:**

- Speeds up data retrieval by storing frequently accessed data in memory.
- Supports various data structures such as strings, hashes, lists, sets, and more, offering flexibility in handling data.
- Enhances scalability by allowing replication and partitioning of data across multiple Redis nodes.
- Provides features like transactions, pub/sub, Lua scripting, and built-in expiration, enhancing application functionality.


## **Docker**

**Description:** Docker is an open-source platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of applications. It achieves this by encapsulating applications into containers, which are standalone executable packages. Containers include everything needed to run an application - the code, runtime, system tools, system libraries, and settings.

**Reasons for Incorporation:**

- Ensures consistency across multiple development and release cycles by maintaining the environment configuration.
- Facilitates continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD), making the development process more efficient.
- Containers are lightweight, increasing the application's performance.
- Supports scalability by allowing simple replication of containers.

## **Kubernetes**

**Description:** Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration system for automating application deployment, scaling, and management. It works with a range of container tools, including Docker.

**Reasons for Incorporation:**

- Provides a platform to schedule and run containers on clusters of physical or virtual machines.
- Improves efficiency through resource optimization, allocating resources where and when they're needed.
- Ensures high availability of applications by restarting failed containers, replacing and rescheduling containers when nodes die, killing containers that don't respond to user-defined health checks, and only advertising services when theyâ€™re ready to serve users.
- Facilitates both declarative configuration and automation.

## **NGINX Load Balancing**

**Description:** NGINX is a web server that can be used as a reverse proxy, load balancer, and HTTP cache. Its load balancing feature distributes network or application traffic across a number of servers to improve responsiveness and availability of applications, websites, or databases.

**Reasons for Incorporation:**

- Enhances the distribution of workloads across multiple computing resources.
- Increases application availability and reliability through redundancy.
- Provides flexibility to add or subtract servers as demand dictates.
- Handles SSL encryption/decryption, offloading this task from the application servers to free up resources.

## **Cloudflare CDN (Content Delivery Network)**

**Description:** Cloudflare is a service that offers a CDN among other features. A CDN is a network of servers located around the world that cache content from your website, such as images, CSS, and JavaScript. When a user visits your site, the CDN delivers this content from the closest server, speeding up the page load time.

**Reasons for Incorporation:**

- Reduces latency and accelerates site load times by delivering content from servers closest to the user.
- Improves website performance and user experience.
- Reduces bandwidth costs by caching and serving static content.
- Provides DDoS protection by absorbing and mitigating threats before they reach your server.

## **Cloudflare DNS**

**Description:** Cloudflare DNS is a Domain Name System service that translates human-readable domain names (like 'www.example.com') into IP addresses that machines can understand. It is built on a global network designed to deliver a fast, secure, and reliable experience to end users.

**Reasons for Incorporation:**

- Offers fast DNS lookups, improving the speed at which users can access your site.
- Provides DNSSEC to protect against forged DNS answers.
- Reduces latency due to its extensive global network.
- Offers DDoS protection at the DNS level.
