### **Description**

The Forms section of the website serves as an important channel for gathering information from and interacting with users. This section hosts two distinct forms: a prequalification form integrated via an iframe and a standard contact us form. These forms facilitate direct communication with users, enabling them to prequalify for services or reach out for additional information or support.

### **Components**

1. **Iframe Prequalification Form:** This form is integrated into the website via an iframe, allowing users to fill out a prequalification form without leaving the site. The data entered into this form helps to prequalify users for specific services or products, ensuring they meet certain criteria before proceeding.

2. **Contact Us Form:** This form provides a straightforward way for users to get in touch with the company. It typically includes fields for the user's name, email address, subject, and a message.

### **Pages**
1. A dedicated prequalification page, that has other sections relevant to helping understand the process or services
2. A dedicated Contact Us page, which includes information relevant to the company for branding.


### **Admin Functions**

1. **Form Configuration:** Admins should be able to configure the fields in the forms, as well as the actions taken upon submission, such as sending an email notification or storing the submission in a database.

2. **Integration Management:** For the iframe prequalification form, admins should be able to manage the integration settings, such as the source URL of the form and the iframe dimensions.

3. **Submission Management:** Admins should have a way to view, search, and manage form submissions. This could involve a submissions dashboard or integration with an email or CRM system.

### **Other Relevant Details**

1. **Security:** Forms should be secured using techniques such as CAPTCHA and input sanitization to prevent spam and injection attacks. 

2. **Privacy:** Compliance with data privacy regulations, like GDPR or CCPA, is crucial when collecting user data. This might involve providing a privacy policy link or adding a consent checkbox to the forms.

3. **User Experience:** Forms should be easy to fill out and submit, with clear instructions and error messages. The prequalification form, in particular, should load correctly within the iframe and provide a seamless user experience.

4. **Responsiveness:** Both forms should be fully responsive and usable on all device types and screen sizes.
