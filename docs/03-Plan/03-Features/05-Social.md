### **Description** 

The Social section of the website serves as the hub for all social media-related activities. It aims to enhance user engagement, promote brand visibility, and foster community interaction. This section includes social media icons that lead to the company's various social media profiles, and a dynamic component that displays recent social media posts.

### **Components**

1. **Social Media Icons**: These icons, representing different social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram, etc., are placed in key navigation areas to encourage users to visit and interact with the company's social media profiles. They are designed to be noticeable yet unobtrusive to the overall website design.

2. **Recent Social Media Posts**: This component dynamically pulls recent posts from the company's various social media feeds and displays them on the website. It serves as a window into the company's social media activity, giving visitors a snapshot of the brand's latest updates and engagements.

### **Pages**

The Social section may not necessarily be a standalone page, but rather integrated into existing pages, such as the homepage, about page, or contact page. It can also be included in the website's footer or header, which appears across all pages for consistent visibility.


### **Details**

1. **Responsiveness**: Ensure that the Social section is fully responsive and displays correctly on all devices and screen sizes.

2. **Speed**: The Social section should load quickly to provide a good user experience and not affect the overall website performance. Consider lazy loading for the Recent Social Media Posts component.

3. **Design Consistency**: The design of the Social section, including the social media icons and post display, should be consistent with the overall website design and branding.

4. **Privacy and Security**: Follow best practices for user privacy and security, especially when integrating with social media platforms. Ensure compliance with each platform's API usage policies.
