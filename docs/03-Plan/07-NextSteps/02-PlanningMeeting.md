# Planning Meeting

We require a planning meeting, to fully detail the requirements of your site. This meeting results in a comprehensive document that guides development, as the central source of truth.

This document will detail in full requirements for data, representation, proceesses, and more.

Here's how it works:

## 1. Planning Meeting

We initiate the development process with a comprehensive **Planning Meeting**. This meeting is a crucial opportunity for us to gain a deep understanding of your website's objectives, the specific features you require, your target audience, and other relevant details. 

During this meeting, we will discuss:

- Your business and its goals
- The purpose of your website
- Your target audience and their needs
- Any specific website features or functionality you require
- Your preferences for the website's look and feel
- Your project timeline and budget

## 2. Project Charter Creation

Following the Planning Meeting, our team will create a **Project Charter**. This document is the central source of truth for your web development project. It will detail in full the requirements for:

- Auth: Discuss who and what needs to perform actions on the site and admin portal
- CMS: What content will need to be managed and displayed
- Data: What information will be stored and displayed on the site
- Representation: How this data will be presented to the users
- Processes: The actions that users can take on the site, and how the site will respond
- Other specific requirements: These could include things like site performance, security, accessibility, or search engine optimization

The Project Charter will also outline the project timeline, deliverables, and responsibilities of each party involved.

## 3. Client Review

Once the Project Charter is ready, we will present it to you for **Client Review**. This stage is designed to ensure that our understanding of your requirements is correct and that the proposed solution meets your expectations.

During the Client Review, we encourage you to:

- Ask any questions you may have
- Provide feedback on the proposed solution
- Suggest changes or additions

## 4. Project Charter Acceptance

After you've reviewed and are satisfied with the Project Charter, we'll proceed to the **Project Charter Acceptance** stage. At this point, you formally accept the Project Charter, confirming that we've correctly understood your requirements and can proceed with the development.

## 5. Development Begins

With the Project Charter accepted, **Development** can begin. Our team will start designing and building your website according to the agreed-upon plan.

During the development phase, we will keep you updated with regular progress reports and will remain open to your feedback and suggestions. We believe in maintaining a close relationship with our clients to ensure the final product aligns with their vision and exceeds their expectations.

Once the website is ready, it will go through rigorous testing to ensure functionality and performance before it is finally launched.
