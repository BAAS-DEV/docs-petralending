These are questions related to the general look and feel of your site. 

1. Can you provide some examples of websites you admire, and what aspects of their design appeal to you?
2. Do you have any existing brand guidelines (color schemes, fonts, logos, etc.) that the design needs to adhere to?
3. How do you want visitors to feel when they interact with your website? (e.g., excited, calm, inspired)
4. Do you prefer a more modern or traditional aesthetic?
5.  What elements of your current site (if applicable) do you like and want to preserve, and which ones would you like to change?
6.  What are some of your competitors' websites, and what do you like/dislike about their design?
7.  Do you have any specific color preferences or aversions for the site?
8.  Do you have any requirements for accessibility or inclusivity in the design?
9.  Do you anticipate needing multilingual support on your website?
